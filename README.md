# Cosmo

## Introduction
Cosmo is a music player for Android. It based on the usage usage of the MediaBrowser class in Android (a large part of this app borrows heavily from the [Android Universal Music Player](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-UniversalMusicPlayer)). The design is based on Google's [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io) ([Plaid](https://github.com/nickbutcher/plaid) serves as a reference for a number of animations implemented in this application).

Cosmo is aimed at providing the user with a simple, fast and fluid interface to browse their library and playback of the music in the library.

The application is currently in very early stages of development and a lot of things might change during the course of the development.
